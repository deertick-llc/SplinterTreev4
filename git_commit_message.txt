- Remove duplicate uptime command from help_cog.py
- Fix async/await usage in settings_cog.py and help_cog.py
- Standardize setup function pattern across cogs

- TypeError: object NoneType can't be used in 'await' expression
- CommandRegistrationError: The command uptime is already an existing command
