refactor: streamline cog implementation

- Move Sydney's working implementation to base_cog.py including store=True parameter
- Simplify individual cogs to inherit functionality from base_cog.py
- Add update_cogs.py script to maintain consistent cog structure
- Update all cogs to use the new streamlined pattern

This refactor makes the codebase more maintainable by:
1. Centralizing core functionality in base_cog.py
2. Reducing code duplication across cogs
3. Making individual cogs simpler and configuration-focused
4. Providing a tool to ensure consistent cog structure
