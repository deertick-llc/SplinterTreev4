feat: Implement message ID tracking to prevent duplicate messages

This commit introduces a message ID tracking system in the context cog to prevent the bot from sending duplicate messages. This addresses an issue where duplicate messages could occur under certain conditions.

The following changes were made:

- Added a `processed_messages` set to the `ContextCog` class to store the IDs of processed messages.
- Updated the `on_message` listener to check if a message has already been processed before handling it.
- Updated the `add_message_to_context` method to add message IDs to the `processed_messages` set.
- Updated the help command and README to document the new feature.
