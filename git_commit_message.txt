feat: Add router cog for automatic model selection

Add a new router cog that automatically selects the most appropriate model for messages without explicit keywords. Uses ministral-3b to analyze message content and route to specialized models:

- Magnum for formal analytical reasoning
- Gemini for conversational complex reasoning
- Claude-3-Haiku for basic coding
- Nemotron for complex technical tasks
- Sydney for emotional support
- Sonar for trends and current events
- Ministral for general queries

The router uses a structured decision system with clear prioritization rules to ensure consistent and appropriate model selection.
