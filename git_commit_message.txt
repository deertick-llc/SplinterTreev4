fix: prevent duplicate message processing while preserving triggers

- Add module-level handled_messages set in base_cog.py
- Use handled_messages set to track which messages have been processed
- Remove attempt to modify Message objects directly
- Make ContextCog use bot's processed_messages set
- Preserve trigger word functionality while preventing duplicates

This fix ensures messages are properly tracked without modifying Discord objects, while maintaining trigger word functionality.
