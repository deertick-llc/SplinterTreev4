Implement OpenPipe request reporting in context cogs

- Added OpenPipe reporting functionality to BaseCog's generate_response method
- Updated SydneyCog to include OpenPipe reporting in its overridden generate_response method
- This change ensures that each message processed by context cogs is reported to OpenPipe for logging and potential future model training

This implementation allows for better tracking and analysis of bot interactions, which can lead to improved model performance and more accurate responses in the future.
