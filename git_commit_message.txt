fix: standardize vision handling across all vision-capable cogs

- Update Claude 3 Opus, Claude 3 Sonnet, Llama 11B Vision, and Gemini cogs to use proper multimodal format
- Replace text-based image descriptions with native vision capabilities
- Ensure consistent image handling across all vision models using OpenRouter's multimodal format
- Each vision cog now properly handles both image attachments and embed images
