fix: Add dynamic status updates for bot uptime

- Add @tasks.loop for updating status every 30 seconds
- Start status update task in on_ready event
- Add error handling for status updates
- Keep uptime display current and accurate

The bot's status now updates automatically every 30 seconds to show
the current uptime, fixing the issue where it would remain static
after initial boot.
