Removed gemma, claude, and mystery merge nemo cogs

Removed the gemma, claude, and mystery merge nemo cogs from the bot. This was done to reduce the number of models available and to simplify the bot's codebase.

The following files were deleted:

- cogs/gemma_cog.py
- cogs/claude1_1_cog.py
- cogs/claude2_cog.py
- cogs/claude3opus_cog.py
- cogs/claude3sonnet_cog.py
- cogs/mystery_merge_nemo_cog.py

The help command and README.md file were also updated to reflect these changes.
