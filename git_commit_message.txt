fix: Update Sydney cog to use OpenRouter provider

- Changed provider from OpenPipe to OpenRouter to fix 404 errors
- Updated model from "openpipe:Sydney-Court" to "anthropic/claude-2"
- Maintained vision capabilities through OpenRouter's vision API
- Fixed error handling for API responses

This change resolves the 404 errors occurring when Sydney attempts to process messages by using a properly configured model endpoint through OpenRouter.
