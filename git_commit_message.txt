fix: Improve router cog message handling conditions

- Add specific conditions for router response:
  * Bot mentions (ID: 1270760587022041088)
  * "splintertree" keyword
  * "!st_" commands not handled by other cogs
- Add should_handle_message method for cleaner logic
- Maintain existing model selection and routing

The router now only responds to explicit bot interactions, preventing unwanted responses to regular messages.
