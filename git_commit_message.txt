Add custom header for model cog in API calls

- Updated shared/api.py to include a new 'model_cog' parameter in call_openpipe and call_openrouter methods
- Added 'X-Model-Cog' header to API requests when model_cog is provided
- Updated logging tags to include model_cog information
- Ensures each API call can now include the specific model cog that initiated the request
