Fix API client initialization in cogs

- Modified base_cog.py to properly handle API client initialization
- Added API client to bot instance for shared access across cogs
- Improved error handling for API client initialization
- Ensured API client is initialized before loading cogs

This fixes the NameError issues that were occurring when cogs tried to access the API client.
