fix: Improve router cog model selection to match exact cog names

- Update model selection prompt to use full model names
- Modify cog selection logic to match exact `[ModelName]Cog` names
- Maintain existing routing and fallback strategy
- Improve logging and error handling

The router now correctly identifies and routes to cogs based on their exact class names, resolving previous routing issues.
