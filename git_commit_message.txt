feat: Enable image descriptions for non-vision models

Added shared image description functionality to BaseCog and updated relevant cogs to use it. This allows non-vision models to "see" images through descriptions generated by the Llama-3.2-90B-Vision cog. Also updated update_cogs.py to reflect these changes and added Mystery Merge Nemo to the cog update list.
