# ðŸŒ³ SplinterTree v4

A powerful Discord bot that provides access to multiple AI language models with advanced features like shared conversation context, image processing, dynamic prompting, and intelligent message routing.

## âœ¨ Project Architecture

SplinterTree v4 is designed with a flexible, scalable architecture that enables dynamic AI model interactions:

### Key Architectural Components

- **Modular Cog System**: Supports over 15 different AI models with individual cogs for specialized interactions
- **Dynamic Routing**: Intelligent message routing using RouterCog to select optimal AI models
- **Comprehensive AI Integration Layer**: Centralized API client managing interactions across multiple providers
- **Async Python Framework**: Leverages modern async programming patterns for high-performance interactions

### Core Infrastructure Capabilities

- **Persistent Context Management**: SQLite-based conversation tracking
- **Multi-Provider Support**: Seamless integration with OpenPipe, OpenRouter, and direct model APIs
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and fallback mechanisms
- **Multimodal Processing**: Supports text, image, and complex input types

## âœ¨ Features

### Core Features

- **Multi-Model Support**: Access a variety of AI models through OpenRouter and OpenPipe, including specialized models for different tasks.
- **Intelligent Message Routing**: Routes messages to appropriate models based on content with the **RouterCog**, handling DMs and channel activation while preventing routing loops.  The routing logic is detailed in the section below.
- **Context Management**: Manages conversation history using **ContextCog**, with per-channel message history and configurable context window sizes.
- **Shared Context Database**: SQLite-based persistent conversation history shared between all models, enabling cross-model context.
- **Dynamic System Prompts**: Customizable per-channel system prompts with variable support for personalized interactions.
- **Emotion Analysis**: Provides emotion analysis and interaction logging for more engaging responses.
- **Response Reroll**: Button to generate alternative responses if needed.
- **Universal Image Processing**: Automatic image description and analysis for all models, even if they don't have native vision support.
- **File Handling**: Support for text files and images, with automatic content extraction.
- **Administrative Commands**: Manage bot status and channel configurations using **ManagementCog**.
- **Enhanced Error Handling and Logging**: Improved error reporting for better troubleshooting and maintenance.
- **Webhook Integration**: Send responses through configured Discord webhooks using the **WebhookCog**.
- **Agent Cloning**: Create custom variants of existing agents with unique system prompts.
- **PST Timezone Preference**: All time-related operations use Pacific Standard Time (PST) by default.
- **User ID Resolution**: Automatically resolves Discord user IDs to usernames in messages.
- **Attachment-Only Processing**: Handles messages containing only attachments (images, text files) without additional text.
- **Automatic Database Initialization**: Schema is automatically applied on bot startup.
- **OpenPipe Request Reporting**: Automatic logging for analysis and potential model improvement.
- **Message ID Tracking**: Prevents duplicate messages by tracking processed message IDs.
- **Router Mode**: Ability to make the Router respond to all messages in a channel.
- **Per-Channel Activation**: Activate or deactivate bot responses in specific channels.
