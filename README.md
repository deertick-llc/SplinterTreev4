## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Discord Bot Token
- OpenRouter API Key
- OpenPipe API Key
- SQLite3

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SplinterTreev4.git
   cd SplinterTreev4
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API keys and configuration
4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
   python bot.py
   ```

**Note**: The database schema will be automatically applied when the bot starts. There's no need for manual database initialization.

**Important Update**: The bot now uses OpenPipe version 4.32.0, which includes the latest completions endpoint. This ensures improved performance and compatibility with OpenPipe models. The OpenPipe API URL parsing has been updated to handle base URLs correctly, resolving previous 404 errors and improving overall stability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `DISCORD_TOKEN`: Your Discord bot token
- `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`: OpenRouter API key
- `OPENPIPE_API_KEY`: OpenPipe API key
- `OPENPIPE_API_URL`: OpenPipe API URL (ensure this is set correctly)

### Configuration Files
- `config.py`: Main configuration settings
- `temperatures.json`: Model temperature settings
- `dynamic_prompts.json`: Custom prompts per channel
