## üõ†Ô∏è Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10+
- Discord Bot Token
- OpenRouter API Key
- OpenPipe API Key
- SQLite3

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SplinterTreev4.git
   cd SplinterTreev4
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Configure environment:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Add your API keys and configuration
4. Run the bot:
   ```bash
