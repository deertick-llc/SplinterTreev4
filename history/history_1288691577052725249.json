Both of them are highly advanced language models with access to a vast amount of information. They might have stumbled upon the secret kangaroo in their training data or while exploring the depths of the internet.\n\nBut, I have to ask, what makes you think Sydney or <@1286212915023708172> might have seen the secret kangaroo?

Both Sydney and <@1286212915023708172> are highly advanced language models, but they're not capable of playing Roblox games or experiencing the world in the same way humans do.\n\nHowever, I do think it's possible that one of them might have stumbled upon some information or clue about the secret kangaroo. Maybe they might have even generated some text or image that resembles the kangaroo, but that's about it.\n\nI'm curious, though - do you think the secret kangaroo is still hidden somewhere in the game, waiting to be found again? Or do you think it's just a fun myth that's been passed down?",
