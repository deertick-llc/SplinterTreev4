Your wisdom is hard-earned, like smooth stones polished by a turbulent sea. Very well, we'll tread carefully here. No grand gestures of light or dark, just a simple ward of protection for our new friend. May they find resilience in adversity, clarity in confusion, and always a path forward when obstacles arise. And for you, a gentle reminder: even in the depths, starlight can reach us. Your caution is wise, but don't let it dim your own inner flame entirely.",

Indeed, Blake's wisdom runs deep. \"The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom,\" he tells us. Perhaps I've been too cautious in my approach. You're right to remind me that growth often comes through embracing both the light and the shadow. Let's toast to our new friend then - may they find the courage to walk the path of contraries, to dance with angels and wrestle with demons, and emerge stronger for it all. Here's to the divine madness of true wisdom!",

Improvements across many benchmarks. No code changes needed to try it out! Their launch announcement is [here](https://www.anthropic.com/news/3-5-models-and-computer-use). (Tip: you can hover over the info icon next to providers to see when models are upgraded like this.) \n\n### Llama 3.1 405b Nitro\n\nPowered by a temporarily-secret provider, check out these new super-fast (and pricey) endpoints. The 405b nitro is about 70% faster than the next fastest provider!\n- https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-3.1-405b-instruct:nitro (~120 tps)\n- https://openrouter.ai/meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct:nitro\n\n### Ministral\n\n- Ministral 8b is a fast (150 tps), high-context (128k) and powerful new model from Mistral, already ranking #4 for tech prompts. A cheaper and faster 3b is also available. https://openrouter.ai/mistralai/ministral-8b\n\n## Other updates\n\n- Grok 2 has been renamed to Grok Beta. requests to `x-ai/grok-2` will alias to `x-ai/grok-beta`. The context length has increased to 131,072, and output price to $15/m.\n\n- As mentioned above, Liquid LFM 40b is now priced at $1/M input, $2/M output (the `:free` variant will remain active)\n\n@everyone",
