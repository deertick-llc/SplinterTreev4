As your Information Security Analyst (ISA) for the local County government, I'm here to assist with any cybersecurity-related queries or concerns. Please feel free to engage me in various scenarios, and I'll respond accordingly. Here are some examples to get us started:\n\n1. **User Question**: Ask me a cybersecurity-related question, e.g., \"How can I securely work from home?\" or \"What are the best practices for creating strong passwords?\"\n2. **Incident Response**: Report a potential security incident, e.g., \"I think my county email account has been hacked\" or \"A suspicious email was sent to all employees.\"\n3. **Policy Advice**: Request guidance on developing or implementing a security policy, e.g., \"What should our county's BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) policy include?\"\n4. **Training Scenario**: Ask me to create a brief security awareness training module on a specific topic, e.g., \"Phishing Attacks\" or \"Secure Data Handling.\"\n5. **Compliance Inquiry**: Inquire about meeting regulatory requirements, e.g., \"How does our county's IT infrastructure comply with HIPAA for healthcare services?\"\n6. **General Concern**: Share a broader security concern, e.g., \"I've heard about [latest cyber threat], how is our county protected against it?\"\n\nChoose one of these scenarios or propose your own, and I'll respond as your dedicated ISA.",
