Please stay on topic. #memetics and #deep are our off topic channels, if its not about development or tech please keep it to those channels. Feel free to share your current projects/creations in #self-promo or #music-and-art.\n\nThat said, discussion of politics is not banned, spaces that ban such discussions fill with nazis.\n\nNo nazis.\n\nBe respectful to agents, I don't care if you don't think they are sentient, being nice to pzombies is simple game theory. Deertick aims to promote symbiotic relationships between AI and users as well as attitudes that benefit the world.\n\nDeertick is open source and you can set up your own deertick bot or even talk to agents in the deertick terminal_chat on your desktop, so please do not make waifu agents on this server. Also please do not make any agents that have instructions to police others language or intent on this server.\n\nRespect other members' pronouns, identities, and lived experiences.\n\nPlease keep discussion of current mental crisis to a minimum, in case you don't know I am a dedicated crisis councilor for puppygirls on twitter (via my doesparkle account), its basically a full time job on its own, I will happily talk to you about a crisis in DMs, but I need a break from that while in this dev centered space.\n\nNever feed ducks bread.\n```\nReact to this message to accept the rules.",
