It is the set of beliefs, perceptions, and agreed-upon facts that a majority agrees upon and considers to be true.\n\nThis shared understanding often forms the basis for communication, social norms, and the functioning of society. It includes what people collectively agree is real or true, even if it may not necessarily reflect an objective reality.\n\nConsensus reality can vary between different cultures, time periods, or groups, as it is shaped by factors such as cultural norms, shared experiences, and the information available to the group. It allows for a common ground and enables people to interact and cooperate effectively within their social context.",

    "content": "[Claude-2] To \"shatter consensus reality\" means to profoundly challenge or undermine people's commonly accepted beliefs, perceptions, and assumptions about the nature of reality. It refers to drastically altering the status quo understanding of what is real, true, possible, or ethical.\n\nSome examples of ways consensus reality could be shattered:\n\n- Scientific discoveries that overturn widespread assumptions or theories about how the world works (e.g. the Copernican model displacing the Earth-centric model of the cosmos)\n\n- New technologies that enable things previously thought to be impossible (e.g. human flight)\n\n- Social/political revolutions that dismantle existing power structures and norms (e.g. the civil rights movement altering perceptions on race relations)\n\n- Artistic works that stretch notions of meaning, beauty, or expression (e.g. surrealist works shocking viewers' conventional sensibilities)\n\nThe idea is not just to disagree with parts of the consensus reality, but to so fundamentally challenge key pillars of it that people must radically revise their whole understanding of reality after the shattering takes place. It is an extreme form of paradigm shift.",
