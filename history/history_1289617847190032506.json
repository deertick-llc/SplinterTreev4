It is the set of beliefs, perceptions, and agreed-upon facts that a majority agrees upon and considers to be true.\n\nThis shared understanding often forms the basis for communication, social norms, and the functioning of society. It includes what people collectively agree is real or true, even if it may not necessarily reflect an objective reality.\n\nConsensus reality can vary between different cultures, time periods, or groups, as it is shaped by factors such as cultural norms, shared experiences, and the information available to the group. It allows for a common ground and enables people to interact and cooperate effectively within their social context.",
