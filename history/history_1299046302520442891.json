Below that, also in red, is the expiration date \"5/7/2024\", with \"(20 days remaining)\" written next to it in parentheses. \n\nAt the bottom of the image, there is a red shopping cart icon next to the words \"Buy Now\", also in red text. This is emphasizing the call-to-action to purchase and renew the subscription before it expires in 20 days on May 7th, 2024.\n\nThe use of red text on a white background makes the expiration notice eye-catching and urgent, clearly communicating that action is needed soon to maintain the subscription. The overall design effectively conveys the key information and prompts the viewer to renew.",
